# Musical XR publication database

The field of Extended Reality (XR) applied to music has evolved significantly over the past twenty years and currently constitutes an established area of research. The use of XR technologies represents a fundamental paradigm shift for various musical contexts as they disrupt traditional concepts of musical interaction by enabling musicians as well as audiences to interact musically with virtual objects, agents, and worlds. 

In an effort to organize the knowledge accumulated in previous technical and experimental studies on works at the intersection of Music and XR, we have created a freely available dataset of scientific publications in this space and prepared an in-depth analysis covering work between 2011 and 2020. We prepared this analysis using a list of conceptual dimensions belonging to technical, artistic, perceptual and methodological domains.
